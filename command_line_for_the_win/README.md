Accepting the CMD Challenge

Well, in order to upload those screenshots to my sandbox environment 
I got connected to the sftp by typing the command:
sftp my_user@host
Then I entered my password and BOOM we are there

Next I navigate to the media directory where I intended to put my files in
Then I typed the command:
put followed by the screenshot title once at a time

Easy peasy lemon squisy :)
